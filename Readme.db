## DemoLibConvertion-alpha

## Overview

This repo captures the generation of a java library for Processing.
It also shows how to generate the library using either Java CLI or Gradle
(Possibly also Maven, Eclipse and Gradle+Eclipse).

The first folder `loadingRing_singleJava` contains the class+demonstration code under a single pde file.
Notice this is not the typical pde file but the java version.

The second folder, `loadingRing_splitJava`, shows how to decouple the library code from the demonstration pde.

The folder `loadingRing_viaLib` is the third step showing how to build the library using
javac and packaging it with jar. This is describe in detail in loadingRing_viaLib/readme.md [MASTER document]
Notice you will find also the libUseDemonstration filder that has a sketch file demosntrating how to use the
library. Ideally this file is under examples when the library is publish. This way, example files are also
published and linked to this release.

Additionaly, the `gradleDemo` folder shows how to build the library as done in `loadingRing_viaLib` but using
gradle from instructions in [processing-library-template-gradle](https://github.com/enkatsu/processing-library-template-gradle)

## Requirements

## Instructions

## To Do

1. [DONE] Use javadoc command to generate reference docuemntation via Java CLI 
2. Integrae examples into published folder
3. Generate and document library generation using Eclipse
4. Define release license
5. Use JUnit for TDD
6. Define additional files to publishing file in processing as described [here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Library-Guidelines).
